==== empty.iso

Using the option _secondary_iso_images_ is used to attach an iso image during build using hyperv-iso.
There is a problem in using _secondary_iso_image_ together with _cd_files_.

.order of drive letters is a s follows.
- D:\ for the setup iso
- E:\ for _secondary_iso_images_
- F:\ for _cd_files
In this repo _cd_files_ is used to provide access and address scripts used in _ressources/config_.
Depending on the use of _secondary_iso_image_ the drive letters may change.
An empty iso is used to address this problem.
